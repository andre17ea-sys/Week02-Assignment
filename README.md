# Week02-Assignment

##Gallery

Althought most of the points were achieved, the result is not what was expected.

## Rework

A lot of changes and rewrite the code countless times:

- Creating a layout where the **large image fills the entire screen** while keeping the **thumbnail bar on top**.
- Troubleshooting JavaScript errors related to `undefined` images and bad event handling.
- Generating properly scaled images (e.g., setting width to 400px and maintaining proportions) - gave up in the end.

## All the resources used up

I encountered more problems than I expected. It took longer than expected due to conflicting layouts goals.
This project helped me understand the importance of planning layout structure early and the power of responsive design.
